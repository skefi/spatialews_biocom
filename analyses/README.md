# README

This folder contains additional analyses which can be performed on the data (files biocom-grps.rda and data_biocom.rda in the 'outputs' folder), on the spatial metrics (contained in the files indics-data_Nperm_199.rda and indics-model_Nperm_199.rda in the 'outputs' folder) as well the scripts to generate the figures of the paper. 

The plot_fig_xx.R files generate the figures of the paper: 
plot_fig_2groups allows to plot figures 2, 3, S6 and S7
plot_fig_slope-indics.R allows to plot figures 2, S3, S9, S13
plot_fig_raw-indics.R allows to plot figures S2, S8, S12

The file clustering_analyses.R explores different clustering approaches to cluster the sites in different groups. 

The file compare_groups_stats.R contains the statistics performed to compare the different group of sites identified.
